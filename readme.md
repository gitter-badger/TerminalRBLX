# Terminal
The Terminal is a command line interface that mimiks a classic "Terminal" interface on a computer. However, it was engineered to mainly be used by players instead of developers. It takes up the entire screen and has multiple commands. Inside of the repository you'll see two files, `original.rbxl` and `terminal.rbxlx`. The first one is the originally programmed instance of Terminal, in binary format. If you choose to contribute here, please don't touch `original.rbxl`. It only exists for documentation purposes, and most of the code is inside of a single LocalScript, with a giant amount of commands. `terminal.rbxlx` is a newer variant of Terminal, in RXML format. It has most of its code inside of ModuleScripts. It runs the code from ModuleScripts on a LocalScript. This is so you can more easily reverse the code or exploit it. It also follows [my Roblox Lua guidelines](https://gist.github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/5a0bf7a969454084b3a5aded8fccd515).
